		<p>I'm an user experience designer. I have worked on a myriad of interactive projects, designing, coding, leading and managing teams of artists.  The bulk of this work has been creating and developing interactive experiences for websites, mobile applications, and games on diverse platforms.</p>
		<p>In later years I have focused on designing and coding responsive web applications. Occasionally I create functional prototypes to test responsive design, and explore aspects of the user interaction on different situations and devices; i.e. animation speed, transitions, grid layouts, typography size and readability on various screen sizes.</p>
