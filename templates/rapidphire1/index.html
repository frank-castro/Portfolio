		<p>The main challenge with this web application was how to display large amount of data in a friendly manner, allow users to visualize the same data from different point of views, through D3.js charts and other type of filters. 


		The complexity of the information and large amount of data makes this user interface. The goal with this design; simplify the interactivity to its core, minimize the time of development.

We identified the most basic kind of actions users will perform with the application, and removed any redundancy in functionality of ui components. 

Basic type of interactions;
Perform an action (Save, Launch, Visit, Cancel, Delete, Open, Close, Edit, etc).
Select one of many (to perform an action) 
Select multiple (to perform an action)
Type / enter information.

For this interaction, we defined the primary UI elements;

Button with text = Actions
Button with an icon, or an icon + text = Pop-up
Input field = enter information
Check box = select one or multiple options

Note: Pop-ups can not have more than two levels of depth.

The other reason we did it this way was to match better with Angular2 and components.

Tables are the focal point, users can pivot around same data types without loosing the ability to stay aware where in the app they are

Visuals are generated using D3.js </p>
