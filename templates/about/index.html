		<p>I have several years of experience doing all sort of design work, print media, games, interactive design and managing small teams of artists. The latest makes the bulk of my experience.
		<p>From this experience Iâ€™ve learned how important it is to understand and being able to manipulate the technologies we are designing for.</p>
		<p>	New technologies reshape the way we consume information over and over again. I think is imperative to keep an endless cycle of training and learning new technologies, design tools and techniques. to maintain an effective communication between product and audience.</p>
		<p>	Below a list of some of those I use;</p>
		<p>	Design; Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
		<p>	Version control and collaboration; Git, Github.</p>
		<p>	Task Runner; Grunt, Gulp. </p>
		<p>	Package Manager; Bower, NPM. </p>
		<p>	Text editor; Sublime text.</p>
		<p>	Frameworks; AngularJS, Sass (with Susy), and Compass.</p>
		<p>Code; HTML5, CSS3, SVG, Javascript, JQuery, JSON, D3.js and more.</p>
