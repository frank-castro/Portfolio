		<p>I'm an user experience designer. I have worked on diverse projects; designing websites and mobile applications, developing games, and managing small teams of artists.</p>
		<p>In later years I have focused on designing and coding responsive web applications. Occasionally I create functional prototypes to test responsive design, and explore through a range of screen sizes how different aspects of design behave; animation speeds, grid layouts, typography. This workflow allows quickly iterations through technical aspects of the design, and explore different design solutions, before a design goes into final developnment.</p>
