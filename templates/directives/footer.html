		<p>About this website: this baby is 100% designed and coded by me. Desing wise, this is my realm, there are not constrains here... code wise, this is my playground, where I test and experiment with every bit of code I find interesting. I built this site with AngularJS. I used Git, Grunt, Compass and Sass to generate CSS3, Modular scale, and Susy for grid layout. Fonts from Adobe TypeKit. For scroll functionality I use Angular parallax module, and Slick.js library.</p>
