		<p>Prototype of a home page from a design concept. Not responsive. Built in AngularJS. The purpose of this prototype was to test simultaneous events on scroll; parallax and how the large image at the top of the page shrinks as users scroll down the page. <a href="http://www.kipu.frankcastro.com" target="_blank">Visit</a><span> This prototype is visible on desktop only.</span></p>

		<p>I created this to test how far I could take the number of polygons within an specific screen size. Built from javascript library in Github by Byron Knoll. It takes a few seconds to load. (Please use CHROME or SAFARI). Drag the red circle to see the lines redrawing. It resembles a spot light casting a shadow.<a href="http://www.vis-pol.frankcastro.com" target="_blank">Visit</a><span> This prototype is visible on desktop only.</span></p>
