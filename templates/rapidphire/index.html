		<p>rapidPHIRE is a context-aware cyber security Network Traffic Analysis platform for security analysts that provides situational awareness and remediation of cyber threats operating inside SMB and Enterprise networks. Using advanced network traffic analysis and machine learning, rapidPHIRE lets you track threats as they enter your network perimeter, watch lateral movement between endpoints, and develop a complete understanding of your security event history.

The complexity of the information and large amount of data makes this user interface. The goal with this design; simplify the interactivity to its core.

We identified the most basic kind of actions users will perform with the application, and removed any redundancy in functionality of ui components. 

Basic type of interactions;
Perform an action (Save, Launch, Visit, Cancel, Delete, Open, Close, Edit, etc).
Select one of many (to perform an action) 
Select multiple (to perform an action)
Type / enter information.

For this interaction, we defined the primary UI elements;

Button with text = Actions
Button with an icon, or an icon + text = Pop-up
Input field = enter information
Check box = select one or multiple options

Note: Pop-ups can not have more than two levels of depth.

The other reason we did it this way was to match better with Angular2 and components.

Tables are the focal point, users can pivot around same data types without loosing the ability to stay aware where in the app they are

Visuals are generated using D3.js </p>
