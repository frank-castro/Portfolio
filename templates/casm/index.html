		<p>The Canada Aviation and Space Museum is Canada's national aviation history museum. The museum's collection contains a wide variety of civilian and military aircraft, representing the history of Canadian aviation from the pioneer era before the First World War up to the present day.<br /><br /> The museum learned through a case study, many visitors where interested in looking inside the aircraft and cockpits. This solution augments the physical experience at the museum through a digital solution. Using high definition images of the cockpits, we created a panoramic view of each cockpit. This application was built for iOS (iPhone and iPad).</p>

Hotspots (+) provide aditional information and facts about the aircraft and specifics about the example at the museum.</p>
