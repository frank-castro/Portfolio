	<p>About me</p>
	<p>I have several years of experience doing all sort of design work, print media, games and interactive design. The latest makes the bulk of my experience.
	<p>From this experience Iâ€™ve learned how important it is to understand the capabilities of the technologies we are designing for.</p>
	<p>	New technologies reshape the way we consume information over and over again. To me it has become imperative to keep a cycle of training and learning new technologies, design tools and techniques.</p>
	<p>	Some of those are;</p>
	<p>	Design; Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
	<p>	Management; Git, Github.</p>
	<p>	Task Runner; Grunt, Gulp. </p>
	<p>	Package Manager; Bower, NPM. </p>
	<p>	Text editor; Sublime text.</p>
	<p>	Frameworks; AngularJS, Sass (with Susy), and Compass.</p>
	<p>Code; HTML5, CSS3, SVG, Javascript, JQuery, D3.js and other libraries.</p>
