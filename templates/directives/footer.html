		<p>About this website: This site is my playground, where I tests and experiment with every new bit of code I learn and showcase my most recent work and skills. This site is in constant flux. I built this site with AngularJS. I used Git, Grunt, Compass and Sass to generate CSS3, Modular scale, and Susy for grid layout. Fonts from Adobe TypeKit. For scroll functionality I use Angular parallax module, and Slick.js library.</p>
