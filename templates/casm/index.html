		<p>The Canada Aviation and Space Museum is Canada's national aviation history museum. The museum's collection contains a wide variety of civilian and military aircraft, representing the history of Canadian aviation from the pioneer era before the First World War up to the present day.<br /><br /> After a case study performed by the museum, it was decided to address some of the key visitor's requests; the ability to look inside the cockpits. The fragility of these aircraft, and the variety of sizes and shapes makes public access to the interior of these examples at the museum difficult to implement. <br /><br />As a result the museum requested the development of this app, this solution augments the experience at the museum through a digital experience. Using high definition images of the cockpits, we created a panoramic view of each cockpit. This application was built for iOS (iPhone and iPad).</p>

		<p>On the panoramic view visitors can interact with the cockpits by swiping on the screen, or turning around while holding the mobile device up. Pinching on the screen allows zoom in and out. Hotspots (+) provide aditional information and facts about the aircraft and specifics about the example at the museum.</p>
